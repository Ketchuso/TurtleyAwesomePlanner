# 📆 Personal Calendar App

A simple calendar web application where users can log in, view their own daily tasks, and check off completed ones. Originally designed as a couple calendar, the current version supports only individual calendars due to time constraints.

## ✨ Features

- User login & session management
- Daily task list based on user and current date
- Ability to check/uncheck tasks (☑️ / ◻️)
- Add, edit, and delete calendar events
- Settings page to update username and password
- Flask backend + React frontend
- Clean and intuitive UI

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (JavaScript)
- **Backend**: Flask (Python), Flask-RESTful
- **Database**: SQLite
- **API communication**: REST (via `fetch`)

## These are features we planned but haven't implemented yet:

- Couple Calendar: allow users to pair accounts and view shared events
- Color the date that has common event with partner
- Notifications and reminders
- Event tagging and categorization
- Calendar view (monthly/weekly)
